	    <p>I will have a bunch of extra time this summer so maybe I'll find the motivation to write about some topics I'm interested in. I'm working a 9-5 job so after work I'll probably have nothing to do (for at least some days of the week) and some extra projects could fill my time. If there is anything I feel that other people might find interesting I'll put it here.</p>

	    <p>To make this easier I made a simple static site "generator" (really just two shell scripts) that looks through the all the posts and pulls the metadata from the start of each file into a table. It also adds files and their metadata to the <a href="../files.html">files</a> page. I'll probably add more functionality soon, maybe word counts for blog posts and support for recursive directories so the files can be more organized.</p>
